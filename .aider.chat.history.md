The Memory Match Cards Game is a simple yet engaging mini-app consisting of a 4×3 grid with 12 face-down cards containing 6 matching pairs. At the start of each game, the cards are randomly shuffled, ensuring a unique experience every playthrough. Players tap any card to flip it over, revealing an emoji or icon, and then flip a second card to try to find a match. If the two flipped cards match, they remain face-up; if not, they automatically flip back after a short delay, challenging the player’s concentration and memory skills. The game tracks the player’s performance through a timer and/or move counter, which begin once the first card is flipped. The objective is to match all pairs using the fewest moves or completing the puzzle in the shortest time possible. Once all six pairs are found, a clean and simple win screen appears showing the player's total time, number of moves, and an option to restart the game. Lightweight, visually clean, and easy to use, this game fits perfectly within the allowed features of a Base Mini App and provides a fun, replayable challenge for users of all ages.

The files that will need to be edited (or added) to satisfy the request are:

A minimalist logo featuring a 4x3 grid of face-down cards with a subtle gradient background. The center card shows a pair of matching emojis (e.g., a smiling face and a heart) to represent matching pairs. The design is clean, with rounded corners and a soft shadow, suitable for a mobile app image.
